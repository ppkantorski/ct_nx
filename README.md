<h1 align=center>Chrono Trigger — Nintendo Switch port</h1>

</div>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of *[Chrono Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.chrono)*
(`com.square_enix.android_googleplay.chrono`, v2.1.5). It loads the original game
binaries, patches them and runs them: we natively run the original Android `.so`
files inside a minimal emulated Android environment.

---

### Features

* **Extensive `config.ini`** — screen resolution (independent per handheld/docked,
  up to 4K supersampling), language, custom font loading, text shadows,
  performance tuning, and controller remapping, all editable without rebuilding.
* **Mod support** — drop `.ctp` patch files or loose-file "folder mods" into a
  `mods/` folder and they're applied automatically at startup, without ever
  touching your original game files.
* **Custom font loading** — swap the system-font text for a TTF of your
  choice (a matching pixel font, ChronoType, ships with the project), with
  auto-fit sizing and an optional SNES-style drop shadow.
* **Smoother, sharper visuals** — fixes for the shimmering/stuttering look
  the game has while scrolling or moving, crisp pixel-accurate rendering,
  straightened Equipment menu text, a clearer cursor highlight, and smoother
  diagonal movement.
* **Switch-native controller support** — real button prompts instead of
  touch/keyboard icons, optional right-stick movement, and remapping for the
  otherwise-unused (ZL | ZR | + | −) buttons.
* **Touch UI removed** — the mobile-only on-screen button overlays are
  hidden automatically.
* **Tidier install layout** — saves, mods, and settings each live in their own
  subfolder; upgrading from an older install migrates everything automatically.

---

### How to install

You're going to need the **`.apk`** for version 2.1.5. From it you need:
* `lib/arm64-v8a/libchrono.so` — the engine
* `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so` — the C++ runtime it depends on
* the **entire `assets/` folder** — the game data (`resources.bin`, `001.dat`…
  `008.dat`, `007-en.dat`, `Shaders/`, `build_date.txt`)

To install:
1. Download `ct_nx.zip` and extract it to the root of your Switch SD card.
2. From your `.apk`, extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libchrono.so`** to `/switch/ct/`.
3. From your `.apk`, extract **`lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`** to `/switch/ct/`.
4. From your `.apk`, copy the **whole `assets/` directory** to `/switch/ct/assets/`.
5. *(Optional)* Create `/switch/ct/mods/` and drop in any `.ctp` mods or folder
   mods you want loaded — see [Mods](#mods) below.

If you're upgrading an existing install, just overwrite `ct_nx.nro` (and
`libchrono.so`/`libc++_shared.so`/`assets/` if they changed) — your settings and
save data are migrated automatically on first launch, see **Notes** below.

---

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode. Use a game override (hold R on a title)
or a forwarder, so the homebrew gets the full memory and required syscalls.

Everything the port reads or writes lives under `/switch/ct/`:
* `config.ini` — all settings (see **Configuration**)
* `saves/` — save data (`common.bin`, `meta.bin`, `Chrono_sp_*.dat`) and the
  cocos2d-x `Cocos2dxPrefsFile.txt` settings store, kept in their own subfolder
  so the top-level directory stays tidy
* `mods/` — optional `.ctp` / folder mods (see **Mods**)
* `font/` — optional TTFs for the custom font feature
* `debug.log` — diagnostic log

**Upgrading from an older version:** your settings and saves are migrated
automatically the first time you launch — an old `config.txt` becomes
`config.ini`, and any saves still sitting loose in `/switch/ct/` move into
`/switch/ct/saves/`. Nothing else in the folder is touched.

---

### Configuration

`config.ini` is created (or migrated from an older `config.txt`) on first run.
It's grouped into sections; here's what each key does and its default.


**Screen**
* `screen_width_handheld` / `screen_height_handheld`, `screen_width_docked` /
  `screen_height_docked` *(default 1280x720 / 1920x1080)* — render resolution
  per mode. `-1` (or anything out of range) auto-picks 1280x720 handheld /
  1920x1080 docked.
  - An explicit value is honoured up to 4K, so you can also
  render **above** native for supersampling (e.g. 2560x1440 docked) — keep a
  16:9 ratio to avoid stretching. Applied live: changing dock state mid-session
  resizes the render target with no restart needed.

**Language**
* `language` *(default `default`)* — selects the in-game text/assets. One of
  `en fr de it es ja ko zh zh-Hant` (`zh`/`zh-Hans` = Simplified Chinese,
  `zh-Hant` = Traditional Chinese). The default value `default` selects language
  based upon the current system language with fall back to `en` if not supported.

**Font**
* `game_font` *(default 1)* — render the engine's system-font labels with a TTF
  instead of the Switch's shared font, so they match the in-game look. The
  game's own TTF-rendered labels are unaffected either way. Glyphs the game
  font lacks fall back to the shared font.
* `game_font_path` *(default `/switch/ct/font/ChronoType/ChronoType.ttf`)* —
  path to the TTF to use. If empty, a few common asset locations are probed;
  if none load, falls back to the shared font.
* `game_font_scale` *(default 0.90)* — fine-tune multiplier on the game font's
  auto-fitted size. `1.0` = auto (cap height matched to the shared font); lower
  if it still looks too big, higher if too small.
* `game_font_xscale` *(default 1.0)* — horizontal-only squeeze, for condensing a
  wide/monospaced font so the game's pre-broken lines stay inside their window.
  A proportional font like ChronoType usually needs no squeeze.

**Text shadow**
* `text_shadow` *(default 1)* — draw a crisp, hard-edged drop shadow behind the
  system-font labels, classic CT/SNES style.
* `text_shadow_scale` *(default 1.0)* — multiplier on the shadow's auto offset.
* `text_shadow_alpha` *(default 200, 0-255)* — shadow opacity; also scales with
  each label's own alpha, so fades stay consistent.

**Performance**
* `gl_threaded` *(default 0)* — (experimental) run mesa's GL command submission on a second CPU
  core (glthread), offloading work the single-threaded engine spends inside the
  GPU driver. No-op if mesa lacks it; disable if it causes trouble.
* `gl_no_error` *(default 1)* — skip mesa's internal validation of GL calls,
  removing CPU overhead on a path that fires constantly. The engine's calls are
  already well-formed, so this is safe to leave on.

**Visual & movement fixes** — these smooth out a handful of quirks left over
from the original phone version: filtering, alignment, camera zoom, and a
shimmering/stuttering look during movement. Each flag below is independent
and safe to turn off if it ever causes trouble; most take effect on your next
launch rather than instantly.

* `remove_mobile_ui` *(default 1)* — hides the on-screen touch buttons, since
  you're playing with a controller.
* `cursor_fix` *(default 1)* — keeps selected menu text white with a dark
  highlight behind it, instead of the original's color-inverted look.
* `remove_bilinear_filter` *(default 1)* — sharp, nearest-neighbour texture
  rendering instead of the default's soft/blurred look.
* `fixed_timestep` *(default 1)* — smooths out movement and keeps the intro
  movie's audio in sync, by giving the game a steady frame timing instead of
  a jittery one.
* `ui_scale_fix` *(default 1)* — fixes a display-scaling mismatch left over
  from the game's original phone resolution, which is what causes stretching
  and shimmer across the whole screen. As a side effect you'll see a little
  more of the world at the screen edges.
* `force_nearest` *(default 0)* — a stronger version of
  `remove_bilinear_filter` that also catches a few textures the basic patch
  can't reach.
* `game_area_width_fix` *(default 1)* — fixes a small UI stretch caused by
  the same phone-resolution mismatch as `ui_scale_fix`.
* `menu_alignment_fix` *(default 1)* — straightens out text that sits
  slightly too high on the Equipment menu.
* `field_zoom_fix` *(default 1)* / `field_zoom` *(default 2.0)* — fixes an
  uneven zoom on the field camera that's the real cause of the shimmer you
  see while scrolling around. `field_zoom` sets how zoomed in the camera is —
  lower shows more map, higher shows less. Recommend values are currently 2.0 and 1.75.
* `map_zoom_fix` *(default 1)* / `map_zoom` *(default 2.0)* — the same fix
  and zoom control, for the overworld map screen. Recommend values are currently 2.0 and 1.75.

**Input / controller**
* `native_controller` *(default 1)* — drive the engine purely through its
  native controller path, so on-screen prompts and dialogue button tags show
  Switch buttons. Turn off only for legacy keyboard-style compatibility.
* `controller_glyphs` *(default 1)* — force in-message button tags to the
  controller glyph set (honours any A/B swap) regardless of the engine's own
  last-input-device detection.
* `fix_diagonal_movement` *(default 1)* — smooths diagonal field movement to
  match the speed of cardinal movement (purely visual; no save-data impact).
* `right_stick_mirror` *(default 1)* — lets the right stick also drive
  movement, as if it were the left stick. Right-stick tilt takes priority when
  both sticks are active.
* `key_zl` / `key_zr` / `key_plus` / `key_minus` *(default: unremapped)* —
  remap these otherwise-unused buttons to any of `key_a key_b key_x key_y
  key_l key_r`. The physical button then behaves exactly as if the named
  button were pressed, glyph included.

### Mods

Drop ChronoMod-compatible `.ctp` patch files into your mods folder — `mods/`
by default, or set your own via `mods_dir` in `config.ini` — and they're
applied automatically at startup. **Your original `resources.bin` is never
modified;** ct_nx builds a patched copy in memory instead.

You can also use "folder mods": a subfolder containing loose files at their
normal `resources.bin` path (e.g. `mods/MyMod/Game/common/foo.dat`). If a
`.ctp` and a folder mod both touch the same file, the folder mod wins.

The first time your mods load they're cached to disk, so later launches are
instant — you'll only see the brief "Caching mods…" splash after adding,
removing, or changing something in your mods folder.

**Included tool — `tools/generate_text_ctp.py`:** the game's field messages
were written for a touchscreen (e.g. "Touch blue, yellow, then red…"). This
script rewrites those lines to reference real Switch buttons instead, using
your own `resources.bin`, and packages the result as a `.ctp` ready for your
mods folder:

```
python3 generate_text_ctp.py /path/to/resources.bin
python3 generate_text_ctp.py /path/to/resources.bin --lang en,ja
```

Since it works from your own copy of the game, none of Square Enix's
original text ever leaves your machine — only the substitution script is
ours.

---

### Advanced: offline binary patch tools

`tools/` also includes the standalone Python patchers the boot-time
`config.ini` patches above are based on (`remove_bilinear.py`,
`remove_cursor_invert.py`, `remove_mobile_ui.py`, `remove_menu_buttons.py`).
They edit a `libchrono.so` on disk directly and are kept mainly for reference
and for anyone who wants a pre-patched `.so` outside of ct_nx's own runtime
patching — for normal use, the equivalent `config.ini` flags are simpler,
reversible, and require no re-patching. Each script is self-contained
(Python 3 standard library only) and supports `--dry-run`/`--in-place`/`-o`;
run one with `-h` for details.

### How to build

You're going to need devkitA64 and the following devkitPro packages:
* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-freetype`
* `switch-libpng`
* `switch-harfbuzz`
* `switch-ffmpeg` (+ its codec deps `switch-dav1d`, `switch-libopus`,
  `switch-libvorbisidec`, `switch-libwebp`, `switch-libogg`)
