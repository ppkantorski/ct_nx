  //                  (glthread). The engine is single-threaded and spends much
  //                  of each frame inside the nouveau driver; this offloads that
  //                  onto a spare core, shortening the critical path that
  //                  otherwise needs a CPU/EMC overclock to reach 60fps. Set 0
  //                  to disable if it causes trouble. No-op if mesa lacks it.
  //   gl_no_error -- 1 = skip mesa's internal validation of GL calls (bad enum/
  //                  state checks) before they reach the driver. cocos2d-x's
  //                  calls are already well-formed, so this just removes CPU
  //                  bookkeeping on a path that fires constantly. Set 0 if a
  //                  future mesa build ever mishandles it.
  //   game_font   -- 1 = render the engine's *system-font* labels with a TTF from
  //                  the game/SD instead of the Switch shared font, so they match
  //                  the in-game look. (The game's own TTF labels are unaffected;
  //                  they're already drawn by the engine.) Glyphs the game font
  //                  lacks fall back to the shared font. Set 0 for the old look.
  //   game_font_path -- path to the TTF to use for game_font. Relative to the
  //                  /switch/ct dir (e.g. "assets/font/xxxxx.ttf"). If empty, a
  //                  few common asset locations are probed; if none load, falls
  //                  back to the shared font.
  //   game_font_scale -- fine-tune multiplier on the game font's auto-fitted
  //                  size. 1.0 = auto (cap height matched to the shared font);
  //                  lower (e.g. 0.85) if it still looks too big, higher if small.
  //   game_font_xscale -- horizontal-only squeeze for the game font. 1.0 = none.
  //                  Use < 1 (e.g. 0.7) to condense a wide/monospaced font so the
  //                  game's pre-broken lines stay inside their window. A
  //                  proportional CT font usually needs no squeeze.
  //   text_shadow -- 1 = draw a crisp drop shadow behind the system-font labels,
  //                  in the classic CT/SNES style (offset down-right, hard-edged
  //                  so it suits a pixel font; no blur). 0 = no shadow.
  //   text_shadow_alpha -- shadow opacity, 0..255 (the shadow is black). It also
  //                  scales with each label's own alpha, so fades stay consistent.
  //                  Default 230 -- a strong, solid-looking shadow.
  //   text_shadow_scale -- multiplier on the auto offset (which itself scales with
  //                  the glyph size, ~1px per 12px of glyph). 1.0 = default; >1 for

  //                   640x360 (exact 16:9). ROOT CAUSE FIX for the motion
  //                   shimmer/scoot/thinning-fine-detail artifact, confirmed via
  //                   scale_diag.log: 568x320 never divides evenly into any
  //                   Switch panel (1280x720, 1920x1080, 2560x1440 all give a
  //                   fractional mScaleX/mScaleY -- 2.253521...), so every
  //                   layer -- field, sprites, menu text -- gets stretched by a
  //                   non-integer factor and GL_NEAREST-samples a scrolling,
  //                   per-frame-shifting position, which reads as scoot/shimmer
  //                   in motion and clean at rest. 640x360 divides every Switch
  //                   resolution exactly (2x/3x/4x), so the scale is always a
  //                   whole number with no further patch needed downstream.

  // this (patches.h: apply_field_view_zoom + apply_field_zoom):
  //   1. The VIEW (how much of the map is captured -- FieldMap::init and
  //      setScrollLimit): view_art_px = 640x360 / zoom.
  //   2. The BLIT scale (the "fieldmap" node's setScale, on top of the
  //      outer 2x-handheld/3x-docked display scale from
  //      ui_scale_fix): the node is drawn at view_art_px * zoom.
  // Those two are reciprocal by construction, so the LOGICAL drawn size is
  // always exactly 640x360 design units.
  //
  // IMPORTANT, STILL-OPEN CAVEAT: the field background isn't drawn live --
  // it's rendered once per scroll step into five fixed-size 432x224 art-px
  // RenderTextures allocated in FieldMap::makeField, sized for the stock
  // 320x180 view with a fixed scroll-ahead margin. #1/#2 above resize the
  // *logical* view and blit scale correctly, but NOT that physical texture,
  // which patches.h does not yet touch (would require rewriting ~40
  // interdependent constants inside the 2700-instruction FieldMap::Scroll
  // function -- tracked, not yet done). Net effect: the "always fills the
  // screen" claim above only holds while the requested view still fits
  // inside that fixed 432x224 texture, i.e.
  //     zoom >= max(640/432, 360/224) = ~1.61
  // Below ~1.61 the texture itself becomes the bottleneck: you'll see the
  // same fixed-size patch of map, anchored to a corner, with black in the
  // remaining screen area, rather than more map. Stay at 1.65+ for a safe
  // margin. Going lower is the actual "see more map" feature Patrick wants
  // and needs the Scroll-function rewrite above before it'll work right.
  //

  // Non-integer values still render square/undistorted within the safe
  // range, just without the shimmer-free guarantee in whichever mode it
  // doesn't divide evenly for. One in-between value that DOES stay exact in
  // both modes and clears the ~1.61 floor: 5/3 (~1.667 -> 3.333x/5x).
